Plant care system created using ESP8266 and ESP32-CAM

Add visual access to the plant as a way to iterate on the Automatic Plant watering system, which consists of moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors.

This system takes plant care to the next level by providing users with visual access to their plants throughout the ESP32-CAM. 
This feature allows users to observe their plants' growth and health in real-time, and to identify any potential issues early on.
